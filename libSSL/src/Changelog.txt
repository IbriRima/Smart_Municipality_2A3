* [ADD] Added IPV4Socket::Read() that takes buffer parameter of char *buffer as
        an override.
* [MOD] Added IPV4Socket::Read() std::string buffer version had a defect in it,
        if read was error (-1), it would incorrectly use that an an index for
        the buffer array.  Added protection for edge case.
